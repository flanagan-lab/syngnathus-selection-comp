# Calculating the degree of sexual dimorphism
Other papers have reported varying levels of significant or non-significant size differences between males and females in this species, particularly in terms of standard length (measured from the tip of the snout to the base of the caudal fin). I want to investigate the data that I have to see what sexual size dimorphism is like for this population. I am doing this across all fish that were used, including those trials that had no successful matings.

The aspects of size that I am interested in looking at include:

- **Standard length** (A; yellow line): measured from the tip of the snout to the base of the caudal fin.
- **Torso depth** (B; blue line): measured from the point in front of the dorsal fin down (perpendicular to standard length).
- **Snout-vent length** (C; red line): measured from the tip of the snout to the urogenital opening.

## Checking the assumptions for a pairwise comparison
Before comparing male size to female size I want to ensure the data meets the assumptions. The main two things that I will be looking into include:

1. Equal variances between my groups (using `var.test()`).
2. Normal distribution of the data (using `normalTest()`).

The null hypotheses for these two tests are that the variances are equal and the data is normally distributed.

To account for the fact that fish who are longer may just inherently be deeper as well, I am going to adjust the depth by the standard length of the pipefish prior to funning any analyses

```{r assump-test}
#Adjust the torso depth
fem_mesoFL$depth_adj <- fem_mesoFL$depth/fem_mesoFL$length
mal_mesoFL$depth_adj <- mal_mesoFL$depth/mal_mesoFL$length

#Testing to see if the variances are equal
var.test(fem_mesoFL$length, mal_mesoFL$length) #EQUAL
var.test(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, mal_mesoFL$depth_adj) #EQUAL
var.test(fem_mesoFL$svl, mal_mesoFL$svl) #NOT EQUAL

#Testing for normal distribution - Females
normalTest(fem_mesoFL$length, method = "da") #NOT NORMAL
normalTest(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, method = "da") #NORMAL
normalTest(fem_mesoFL$svl, method = "da") #NORMAL

#Testing for normal distribution - Males
normalTest(mal_mesoFL$length, method = "da") #NORMAL
normalTest(mal_mesoFL$depth_adj, method = "da") #NORMAL
normalTest(mal_mesoFL$svl, method = "da") #NORMAL

```

## Investigate distributions and run the tests
Looking at the distributions below I do not expect to see differences in standard length, but maybe in depth and SVL. I will run one of three tests depending on the results of the above assumption testing:

1. If **both** assumptions are met: _Two Sample t-test_
2. If only the **variances** are not equal, but the data is normal: _Welch Two Sample t-test_
3. If the **data is not normal**, regardless of whether variances are equal: _Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction_

Based on this, I will run a Wilcoxon test for standard length, a Welch two sample t-test for snout-vent length, and a two sample t-test for torso depth (adjusted).

#Combining the datasets
fem_mesoFL$Sex <- "F"
mal_mesoFL$Sex <- "M"
all_sex_meso <- rbind(fem_mesoFL[, c("length", "depth_adj", "svl", "Sex")], mal_mesoFL[, c("length", "depth_adj", "svl", "Sex")])

length <- ggplot(data = all_sex_meso, aes(x = length)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Sex),
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 position = 'identity') +

  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Sex),
                 alpha = 0.5,

       title = "Depth of male and female pipefish")

svl <- ggplot(data = all_sex_meso, aes(x = svl)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Sex),
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 position = 'identity') +

       y = "Number of Pipefish",
       title = "Snout-vent length of male and female pipefish")

plot_grid(length, depth, svl,
          ncol = 3)

```

```{r t-test-sd}
#Running the appropriate test
wilcox.test(fem_mesoFL$length, mal_mesoFL$length)
t.test(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, mal_mesoFL$depth_adj, var.equal = TRUE)
t.test(fem_mesoFL$svl, mal_mesoFL$svl, var.equal = FALSE)
```

From these results we can see that there are no significant differences between male and female pipefish in terms of standard length. However, female dusky pipefish are significantly deeper that males and possess a significantly longer snout-vent length. For those two morphometrics I am going to run a power test to ensure that we are confident in our results.

```{r power-test}

#Checking the power - SVL
d_mean_svl <- abs(mean(fem_mesoFL$svl, na.rm = TRUE) - 
                    mean(mal_mesoFL$svl, na.rm = TRUE))
pool_sd_svl <- sqrt((var(fem_mesoFL$svl, na.rm = TRUE) + 
                       var(mal_mesoFL$svl, na.rm = TRUE))/ 2)
d_svl <- d_mean_svl/pool_sd_svl

pwr.t.test(n = nrow(fem_mesoFL), 
           d = d_svl,
           sig.level = 0.05,
           type = 'two.sample',
           alternative = 'two.sided')

#Checking the power - Depth
d_mean_depth <- abs(mean(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, na.rm = TRUE) - 
                      mean(mal_mesoFL$depth_adj, na.rm = TRUE))
pool_sd_depth <- sqrt((var(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, na.rm = TRUE) + 
                         var(mal_mesoFL$depth_adj, na.rm = TRUE))/ 2)
d_depth <- d_mean_depth/pool_sd_depth
pwr.t.test(n = nrow(fem_mesoFL), 
           d = d_depth,
           sig.level = 0.05,
           type = 'two.sample',
           alternative = 'two.sided')

```

For both variables we have a power of over 0.9 or over 90% so we can be confident in our interpretation.

# Calculating mating and reproductive success for individuals who mated
_Syngnathus floridae_ (dusky pipefish) were sampled from three distinct seagrass beds around Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida. Sexually mature females (standard length $\ge$ 120mm) and pregnant males were collected and brought back to the University of Tampa and put into experimental breeding populations. In these trials, 8 males and 8 females were housed together in a 140L tank for a period of 14-days and allowed to mate freely. Parentage analysis was done with all of the pregnant males from the trials to figure out how many times each male and female mated, and the number of eggs that were transferred. The results of that are here.

First I had to calculate the mating and reproductive success for each male and female who mated based on the assigned mom for each genotyped embryo.

```{r calc-success, file="R/calc_fitness.R", warning=FALSE}

```

After running the above R script we have two datasets, `mal_fitness` and `fem_fitness`. These datasets include information about the mating success (number of mates) and reproductive success (Number of embryos transferred). We can split reproductive success up further later if we want to from the total number of embryos transferred to the number of embryos developed and the number that were undeveloped. 

I want to include all of the other metadata that I have for these individuals (traits, collection location, latency to pregnancy, etc.) as well as tack on all of the information for the individuals who did not mate. To do that I am going to need to merge the fitness datasets with `fem_meso` and `mal_meso`.

```{r merge-fit-meso}
#Make a column in *_meso that contains the full fishID (i.e. FL1M3) to match the 
#formatting in the fitness datasets (make sure they have the same name for merging purposes)
fem_mesoFL$momID <- paste0("FL", fem_mesoFL$trial_num, "F", fem_mesoFL$fishID)
mal_mesoFL$maleID <- paste0("FL", mal_mesoFL$trial_num, "M", mal_mesoFL$fishID)

#Merge the datasets based on the columns created above
fem_allFL <- merge(fem_mesoFL, fem_fitness, by = "momID", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)
mal_allFL <- merge(mal_mesoFL, mal_fitness, by = "maleID", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)
```

There are a few trials that I want to remove from the analysis:

  1. All trials where there were no successful matings (7, 9, 10, 11).
  
  2. Trial 1, a male gave birth and the babies were immediately eaten by the adults so the trial was ended early and therefore I was unable to get any parentage information for that trial.
  
I also want to replace the NAs that were automatically added to the columns from the fitness dataset (MatingSuccess, NumDeveloped, NumUndeveloped, totalEggs) with 0s and add a column to the female dataset that tells me whether or not the female mated (with 1 or 0).
  
```{r subset-successful-trials}
#Subset the merged datasets to remove trials without successful matings and Trial 1
fem_succFL <- subset(fem_allFL, !(trial_num %in% c(7, 9, 10, 11, 1)))
mal_succFL <- subset(mal_allFL, !(trial_num %in% c(7, 9, 10, 11, 1)))

#Replace NAs with 0s in the columns related to fitness
mal_succFL[, c("MatingSuccess", "NumDeveloped_Calc", 
               "NumUndeveloped_Calc", "totalEggs")] <- sapply(mal_succFL[, c("MatingSuccess", 
                                                                             "NumDeveloped_Calc", 
                                                                             "NumUndeveloped_Calc", 
                                                                             "totalEggs")],
                                                              function(x)
                                                                ifelse(is.na(x), 0, x))

fem_succFL[, c("MatingSuccess", "NumDeveloped", 
               "NumUndeveloped", "totalEggs")] <- sapply(fem_succFL[, c("MatingSuccess", 
                                                                        "NumDeveloped", 
                                                                        "NumUndeveloped", 
                                                                        "totalEggs")],
                                                         function(x)
                                                           ifelse(is.na(x), 0, x))

#Add a column for females to denote mated or unmated
fem_succFL$mated <- ifelse(fem_succFL$MatingSuccess > 0, 1, 0)

```
