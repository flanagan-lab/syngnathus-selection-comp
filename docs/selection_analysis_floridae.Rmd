# Calculating the degree of sexual dimorphism
Other papers have reported varying levels of significant or non-significant size differences between males and females in this species, particularly in terms of standard length (measured from the tip of the snout to the base of the caudal fin). I want to investigate the data that I have to see what sexual size dimorphism is like for this population. I am doing this across all fish that were used, including those trials that had no successful matings.

The aspects of size that I am interested in looking at include:

- **Standard length** (A; yellow line): measured from the tip of the snout to the base of the caudal fin.
- **Torso depth** (B; blue line): measured from the point in front of the dorsal fin down (perpendicular to standard length).
- **Snout-vent length** (C; red line): measured from the tip of the snout to the urogenital opening.

## Checking the assumptions for a pairwise comparison
Before comparing male size to female size I want to ensure the data meets the assumptions. The main two things that I will be looking into include:

1. Equal variances between my groups (using `var.test()`).
2. Normal distribution of the data (using `normalTest()`).

The null hypotheses for these two tests are that the variances are equal and the data is normally distributed.

To account for the fact that fish who are longer may just inherently be deeper as well, I am going to adjust the depth by the standard length of the pipefish prior to funning any analyses

```{r assump-test}
#Adjust the torso depth
fem_mesoFL$depth_adj <- fem_mesoFL$depth/fem_mesoFL$length
mal_mesoFL$depth_adj <- mal_mesoFL$depth/mal_mesoFL$length

#Testing to see if the variances are equal
var.test(fem_mesoFL$length, mal_mesoFL$length) #EQUAL
var.test(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, mal_mesoFL$depth_adj) #EQUAL
var.test(fem_mesoFL$svl, mal_mesoFL$svl) #NOT EQUAL

#Testing for normal distribution - Females
normalTest(fem_mesoFL$length, method = "da") #NOT NORMAL
normalTest(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, method = "da") #NORMAL
normalTest(fem_mesoFL$svl, method = "da") #NORMAL

#Testing for normal distribution - Males
normalTest(mal_mesoFL$length, method = "da") #NORMAL
normalTest(mal_mesoFL$depth_adj, method = "da") #NORMAL
normalTest(mal_mesoFL$svl, method = "da") #NORMAL

```

## Investigate distributions and run the tests
Looking at the distributions below I do not expect to see differences in standard length, but maybe in depth and SVL. I will run one of three tests depending on the results of the above assumption testing:

1. If **both** assumptions are met: _Two Sample t-test_
2. If only the **variances** are not equal, but the data is normal: _Welch Two Sample t-test_
3. If the **data is not normal**, regardless of whether variances are equal: _Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction_

Based on this, I will run a Wilcoxon test for standard length, a Welch two sample t-test for snout-vent length, and a two sample t-test for torso depth (adjusted).

#Combining the datasets

mal_mesoFL$Sex <- "M"
all_sex_meso <- rbind(fem_mesoFL[, c("length", "depth_adj", "svl", "Sex")], mal_mesoFL[, c("length", "depth_adj", "svl", "Sex")])

length <- ggplot(data = all_sex_meso, aes(x = length)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Sex),
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 position = 'identity') +

          ncol = 3)

```

```{r t-test-sd}
#Running the appropriate test
wilcox.test(fem_mesoFL$length, mal_mesoFL$length)
t.test(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, mal_mesoFL$depth_adj, var.equal = TRUE)
t.test(fem_mesoFL$svl, mal_mesoFL$svl, var.equal = FALSE)
```

From these results we can see that there are no significant differences between male and female pipefish in terms of standard length. However, female dusky pipefish are significantly deeper that males and possess a significantly longer snout-vent length. For those two morphometrics I am going to run a power test to ensure that we are confident in our results.

```{r power-test}

#Checking the power - SVL
d_mean_svl <- abs(mean(fem_mesoFL$svl, na.rm = TRUE) - 
                    mean(mal_mesoFL$svl, na.rm = TRUE))
pool_sd_svl <- sqrt((var(fem_mesoFL$svl, na.rm = TRUE) + 
                       var(mal_mesoFL$svl, na.rm = TRUE))/ 2)
d_svl <- d_mean_svl/pool_sd_svl

pwr.t.test(n = nrow(fem_mesoFL), 
           d = d_svl,
           sig.level = 0.05,
           type = 'two.sample',
           alternative = 'two.sided')

#Checking the power - Depth
d_mean_depth <- abs(mean(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, na.rm = TRUE) - 
                      mean(mal_mesoFL$depth_adj, na.rm = TRUE))
pool_sd_depth <- sqrt((var(fem_mesoFL$depth_adj, na.rm = TRUE) + 
                         var(mal_mesoFL$depth_adj, na.rm = TRUE))/ 2)
d_depth <- d_mean_depth/pool_sd_depth
pwr.t.test(n = nrow(fem_mesoFL), 
           d = d_depth,
           sig.level = 0.05,
           type = 'two.sample',
           alternative = 'two.sided')

```

For both variables we have a power of over 0.9 or over 90% so we can be confident in our interpretation.

# Calculating mating and reproductive success for individuals who mated
_Syngnathus floridae_ (dusky pipefish) were sampled from three distinct seagrass beds around Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida. Sexually mature females (standard length $\ge$ 120mm) and pregnant males were collected and brought back to the University of Tampa and put into experimental breeding populations. In these trials, 8 males and 8 females were housed together in a 140L tank for a period of 14-days and allowed to mate freely. Parentage analysis was done with all of the pregnant males from the trials to figure out how many times each male and female mated, and the number of eggs that were transferred. The results of that are here.

First I had to calculate the mating and reproductive success for each male and female who mated based on the assigned mom for each genotyped embryo.

```{r calc-success, file="R/calc_fitness.R", warning=FALSE}

```

After running the above R script we have two datasets, `mal_fitness` and `fem_fitness`. These datasets include information about the mating success (number of mates) and reproductive success (Number of embryos transferred). We can split reproductive success up further later if we want to from the total number of embryos transferred to the number of embryos developed and the number that were undeveloped. 

I want to include all of the other metadata that I have for these individuals (traits, collection location, latency to pregnancy, etc.) as well as tack on all of the information for the individuals who did not mate. To do that I am going to need to merge the fitness datasets with `fem_meso` and `mal_meso`.

```{r merge-fit-meso}
#Make a column in *_meso that contains the full fishID (i.e. FL1M3) to match the 
#formatting in the fitness datasets (make sure they have the same name for merging purposes)
fem_mesoFL$momID <- paste0("FL", fem_mesoFL$trial_num, "F", fem_mesoFL$fishID)
mal_mesoFL$maleID <- paste0("FL", mal_mesoFL$trial_num, "M", mal_mesoFL$fishID)

#Merge the datasets based on the columns created above
fem_allFL <- merge(fem_mesoFL, fem_fitness, by = "momID", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)
mal_allFL <- merge(mal_mesoFL, mal_fitness, by = "maleID", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)
```

There are a few trials that I want to remove from the analysis:

  1. All trials where there were no successful matings (7, 9, 10, 11).
  
  2. Trial 1, a male gave birth and the babies were immediately eaten by the adults so the trial was ended early and therefore I was unable to get any parentage information for that trial.
  
I also want to replace the NAs that were automatically added to the columns from the fitness dataset (MatingSuccess, NumDeveloped, NumUndeveloped, totalEggs) with 0s and add a column to the female dataset that tells me whether or not the female mated (with 1 or 0).
  
```{r subset-successful-trials}
#Subset the merged datasets to remove trials without successful matings and Trial 1
fem_succFL <- subset(fem_allFL, !(trial_num %in% c(7, 9, 10, 11, 1)))
mal_succFL <- subset(mal_allFL, !(trial_num %in% c(7, 9, 10, 11, 1)))

#Replace NAs with 0s in the columns related to fitness
mal_succFL[, c("MatingSuccess", "NumDeveloped_Calc", 
               "NumUndeveloped_Calc", "totalEggs")] <- sapply(mal_succFL[, c("MatingSuccess", 
                                                                             "NumDeveloped_Calc", 
                                                                             "NumUndeveloped_Calc", 
                                                                             "totalEggs")],
                                                              function(x)
                                                                ifelse(is.na(x), 0, x))

fem_succFL[, c("MatingSuccess", "NumDeveloped", 
               "NumUndeveloped", "totalEggs")] <- sapply(fem_succFL[, c("MatingSuccess", 
                                                                        "NumDeveloped", 
                                                                        "NumUndeveloped", 
                                                                        "totalEggs")],
                                                         function(x)
                                                           ifelse(is.na(x), 0, x))

#Add a column for females to denote mated or unmated
fem_succFL$mated <- ifelse(fem_succFL$MatingSuccess > 0, 1, 0)

```

# Summary statistics for successfully mated individuals
## Males
Across all `r length(unique(mal_succFL$trial_num))` trials and `r nrow(mal_succFL)` total males, there were `r nrow(mal_succFL[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1,])` males that mated at least one time and `r nrow(mal_succFL[mal_succFL$MatingSuccess > 1,])` of those males had two mates. 

Looking across all males, including the ones that did not mate, this is what we find as the mean, sd, and se for the number of embryos transferred and how many of those developed versus didn't:

|                  | mean| SD| SE| max | min |
|:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|----:|----:|
|Number of Embryos | `r mean(mal_succFL$totalEggs)`|`r sd(mal_succFL$totalEggs)`|  `r sd(mal_succFL$totalEggs)/sqrt(nrow(mal_succFL))`|`r max(mal_succFL$totalEggs)` | `r min(mal_succFL$totalEggs)`|
|Developed Embryos | `r mean(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped)`|`r sd(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped)`|  `r sd(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped)/sqrt(nrow(mal_succFL))`|`r max(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped)` | `r min(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped)`|
|Undeveloped Embryos| `r mean(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped)`|`r sd(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped)`|  `r sd(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped)/sqrt(nrow(mal_succFL))`|`r max(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped)` | `r min(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped)`|

These values will be influenced by the number of 0s coming from males who did not mate. So let's look at the same thing, but this time for only males who had at least one successful mating:

|                  | mean| SD| SE|  max | min |
|:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|----:|----:|
|Number of Embryos | `r mean(mal_succFL$totalEggs[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])`|`r sd(mal_succFL$totalEggs[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])`|  `r sd(mal_succFL$totalEggs[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])/sqrt(nrow(mal_succFL[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1,]))`| `r max(mal_succFL$totalEggs[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])` | `r min(mal_succFL$totalEggs[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])` |
|Developed Embryos | `r mean(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])`|`r sd(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])`|  `r sd(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])/sqrt(nrow(mal_succFL[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1,]))`|`r max(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])` | `r min(mal_succFL$NumDeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])` |
|Undeveloped Embryos| `r mean(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])`|`r sd(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])`|  `r sd(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])/sqrt(nrow(mal_succFL[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1,]))`| `r max(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])` | `r min(mal_succFL$NumUndeveloped[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1])` |

We can see from the bottom table that even when we only include males who mated there is still a wide range in the brood size. I want to see what relationship there is between brood pouch size (in terms of both total area and length) and brood size (total number of embryos).

```{r em-v-bp, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplot of the relationship between brood pouch size metrics and the number of embryos a male had.", fig.width=15, fig.height=10 }
#create a subset of only the males who mated
mated_malFL <- mal_succFL[mal_succFL$preg_status == 1, ]

#Plot brood size against the different metrics for pouch size
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(mated_malFL$bp_area,
     mated_malFL$totalEggs,
     xlab = expression(paste("Brood Pouch Area (mm"^2*")")),
     ylab = "Brood Size (# embryos)",
     col = "darkorange",
     pch = 19)
abline(lm(mated_malFL$totalEggs ~ as.numeric(mated_malFL$bp_area)), lwd = 3, lty = 2)
plot(mated_malFL$bp_length,
     mated_malFL$totalEggs,
     xlab = "Brood Pouch Length (mm)",
     ylab = "Brood Size (# embryos)",
     col = "cyan4",
     pch = 19)
abline(lm(mated_malFL$totalEggs ~ as.numeric(mated_malFL$bp_length)), lwd = 3, lty = 2)
```

There may be some correlation happening here, but it doesn't look particularly strong. Let's run some correlations tests to see what they say.

```{r eggs-bp-cor, echo=FALSE}
cor.test(as.numeric(mated_malFL$bp_area), mated_malFL$totalEggs)
cor.test(as.numeric(mated_malFL$bp_length), mated_malFL$totalEggs)
```

There is not a significant correlation between the number of eggs and size of the brood pouch when we look at brood pouch area OR brood pouch length. 

Multiple of the wild study papers looked at correlations between body size in terms of standard length and the number of embryos and found significant positive correlations. 

```{r em-v-sl, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplot of the relationship between standard length (mm) and the number of embryos a male had.", fig.width=15, fig.height=10}
plot(mated_malFL$length,
     mated_malFL$totalEggs,
     xlab = "Standard Length (mm)",
     ylab = "Brood Size (# embryos)",
     col = "#CD5C5C75",
     pch = 19,
     cex = 1.5
)
abline(lm(mated_malFL$totalEggs ~ as.numeric(mated_malFL$length)), lwd = 3, lty = 2)
```

```{r eggs-sl-cor, echo=FALSE}
cor.test(as.numeric(mated_malFL$length), mated_malFL$totalEggs)
```

There appears to be no significant correlation between standard length and the number of eggs in males, unlike what has been found in the species previously. This is unsurprising as we didn't find any hint of a relationship in the brood pouch size metrics and there was a considerable number of males that did not have a full brood pouch.

## Females
Across all `r length(unique(fem_succFL$trial_num))` trials and `r nrow(fem_succFL)` total females, there were `r nrow(fem_succFL[fem_succFL$mated == 1,])` females that mated at least one time, `r nrow(fem_succFL[fem_succFL$MatingSuccess == 2,])` females that mated twice, and `r nrow(fem_succFL[fem_succFL$MatingSuccess == 3,])` that mated 3 times. 

Looking across all females, including the ones that did not mate, this is what we find as the mean, sd, and se for the total number of embryos transferred from each female (across all of her mates if applicable) and how many of those developed versus didn't:

|                  | mean| SD| SE| max | min |
|:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|----:|----:|
|Number of Embryos | `r mean(fem_succFL$totalEggs)`|`r sd(fem_succFL$totalEggs)`|  `r sd(fem_succFL$totalEggs)/sqrt(nrow(fem_succFL))`|`r max(fem_succFL$totalEggs)` | `r min(fem_succFL$totalEggs)`|
|Developed Embryos | `r mean(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped)`|`r sd(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped)`|  `r sd(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped)/sqrt(nrow(fem_succFL))`|`r max(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped)` | `r min(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped)`|
|Undeveloped Embryos| `r mean(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped)`|`r sd(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped)`|  `r sd(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped)/sqrt(nrow(fem_succFL))`|`r max(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped)` | `r min(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped)`|

These values will be influenced by the number of 0s coming from females who did not mate. So let's look at the same thing, but this time for only females who had at least one successful mating:

|                  | mean| SD| SE|  max | min |
|:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|----:|----:|
|Number of Embryos | `r mean(fem_succFL$totalEggs[fem_succFL$mated == 1])`|`r sd(fem_succFL$totalEggs[fem_succFL$mated == 1])`|  `r sd(fem_succFL$totalEggs[fem_succFL$mated == 1])/sqrt(nrow(fem_succFL[fem_succFL$mated == 1,]))`| `r max(fem_succFL$totalEggs[fem_succFL$mated == 1])` | `r min(fem_succFL$totalEggs[fem_succFL$mated == 1])` |
|Developed Embryos | `r mean(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])`|`r sd(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])`|  `r sd(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])/sqrt(nrow(fem_succFL[fem_succFL$mated == 1,]))`|`r max(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])` | `r min(fem_succFL$NumDeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])` |
|Undeveloped Embryos| `r mean(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])`|`r sd(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])`|  `r sd(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])/sqrt(nrow(fem_succFL[fem_succFL$mated == 1,]))`| `r max(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])` | `r min(fem_succFL$NumUndeveloped[fem_succFL$mated == 1])` |

We can see from the bottom table that even when we only include females who mated there is still a wide range in the number of eggs transferred. I want to see what relationship there may be between female body size (in terms of standard length, depth, and SVL) and the number of eggs she transferred. I also want to see on average how many eggs were transferred per mating. I'm going to calculate this by taking the total number of eggs and dividing it by the number of mates. 

```{r egg-per-mate-fem, echo=FALSE}
eggs_per_mate <- fem_succFL$totalEggs/fem_succFL$MatingSuccess
mean(eggs_per_mate, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(eggs_per_mate, na.rm = TRUE)/sqrt(length(eggs_per_mate))
```


```{r em-v-fem-size, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Scatterplot of the relationship between female size metrics and the number of eggs transferred.", fig.width=15, fig.height=8}
#create a subset of only the females who mated
mated_femFL <- fem_succFL[fem_succFL$mated == 1, ]

#Plot total number of eggs transferred against the different metrics for females size
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(mated_femFL$length,
     mated_femFL$totalEggs,
     xlab = "Length (mm)",
     ylab = "Number of eggs transferred",
     col = "darkorange",
     pch = 19)
abline(lm(mated_femFL$totalEggs ~ mated_femFL$length), lwd = 3, lty = 2)
plot(mated_femFL$depth_adj,
     mated_femFL$totalEggs,
     xlab = "Depth (mm)",
     ylab = "Number of eggs transferred",
     col = "cyan4",
     pch = 19)
abline(lm(mated_femFL$totalEggs ~ mated_femFL$depth_adj), lwd = 3, lty = 2)
plot(mated_femFL$svl,
     mated_femFL$totalEggs,
     xlab = "Snout-vent Length (mm)",
     ylab = "Number of eggs transferred",
     col = "purple",
     pch = 19)
abline(lm(mated_femFL$totalEggs ~ mated_femFL$svl), lwd = 3, lty = 2)

```

There may be some correlation happening here, but it doesn't look particularly strong. Let's run some correlations tests to see what they say.

```{r eggs-fem-size-cor, echo=FALSE}

cor.test(mated_femFL$length, as.numeric(mated_femFL$totalEggs))
cor.test(mated_femFL$depth_adj, as.numeric(mated_femFL$totalEggs))
cor.test(mated_femFL$svl, as.numeric(mated_femFL$totalEggs))

```

There is not a significant correlation between the number of eggs and size of the female in terms of standard length, depth, or snout-vent length. Interestingly, however, there is a negative correlation for length and SVL and a positive correlation for depth (but they are all overall weak).
