# Measuring Sexual Selection in _Syngnathus_ pipefish

This is a repository for the analysis of sexual selection pressues in three species of pipefish from the genus _Syngnathus_. This includes the dusky pipefish _Syngnathus floridae_, the Northern pipefish _Syngnathus fuscus_, and the Gulf pipefish _Syngnathus scovelli_. The goals of this study are the following:

  1. Investigate the contributions of pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection across all three species.
  2. Generate Bateman's gradient for male and females within each species.
  3. Attempt to identify traits that may be targets of pre- and post-copulatory selection using selection differentials.
